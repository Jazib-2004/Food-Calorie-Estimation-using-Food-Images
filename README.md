This project uses DIP and YOLOV8 to use food images with horizontal and vertical coins alongside to predict food calories. The model does object detection, image segmentation and then classification using YOLOV8, and then uses K-Nearest Neighbours regressor to predict the calories in the classified food.

## Use streamlit run DIPv1/app.py to run
